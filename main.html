	<h1>Time, Space, and  Complexity </h1>
	 <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is crucial for determining the efficiency of algorithms. Efficient algorithms have low , meaning they can accomplish their tasks quickly even as the input size increases.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       what is the <b>Space complexity</b>  is Big O notation, where 'O(n)' represents linear is a critical aspect to consider, especially when dealing with large datasets, as inefficient memory usage can lead to performance issues and even failure to execute.
