	<h1>Time, Space, and  Complexity </h1>
	 <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is crucial for determining the efficiency of algorithms. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, meaning they can accomplish their tasks quickly even as the input size increases.

        Space complexity deals with the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to execute in relation to the size of the input data. One common notation used to express space complexity is Big O notation, where 'O(n)' represents linear space complexity, meaning the space required grows linearly with the size of the input. In other words, as the input size increases, the amount of memory used by the algorithm also increases proportionally.
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical aspect to consider, especially when dealing with large datasets, as inefficient memory usage can lead to performance issues and even failure to execute.
